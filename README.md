## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using this project to recap what I have learned. 
Learned about :root selector and it helped to make styling easier.

```css
:root {
    --clr-green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --clr-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --clr-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --clr-dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --clr-off-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);

    --ff-base: 'Inter-Variable';
    --fw-regular: 400;
    --fw-semibold: 600;
    --fw-bold: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

Need to learn more about sizing properties (em, rem, vh, vw, px) and responsive layouts.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me to understand CSS a bit better.
